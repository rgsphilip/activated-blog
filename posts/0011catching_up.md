2023 was an intense year for our family, and looking back, I have been able to still do a lot of things that I'm happy with:

- Our family got a cargo bike! We've been taking the kids to and from school in it. As we move into winter, the thing that has kept us off the bike isn't the cold and wet; it has been drivers and less daylight.
- I applied for Beaverton's Transportation Ambassador position to support Beaverton's new Transportation System Plan as well as the Bicycle Advisory Committee. Announcements should be made soon about appointments!
- I'm going through Friends' of Trees Crew Leader training program. I'm learning about how to plant trees, and how to lead others to successfully plant trees.

More on all of these things later; I plan to be writing more in 2024!
