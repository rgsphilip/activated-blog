One of the things the book The Future We Create does in its intro is envision what a beautiful future we could have if we took climate change seriously. One of the difficulties climate activists have is articulating how much _better_ our world could be if we took serious climate action; it's not just about avoiding dire consequences. In that spirit, I spent some time sitting outside and imagining what that better future could look like for my family. This doesn't address how we get there, it's a vision for the world we could have. Today, I'm thinking about how things would be different with fewer cars.

## A World with Fewer Cars

Ah yes, of course... environmentalists are always saying we need fewer cars. It's easy to imagine the annoying things about not having a car. It takes longer to get places, and getting there by bus, bike, or foot may seem like a huge burden. However, a large part of that burden is due to insufficient bus frequency, inconsistent bike infrastructure, and _all the other cars on the road_. It's unpleasant to walk or bike somewhere with the drone of traffic whizzing by next to you. It sucks to wait 20 minutes for a bus. The beauty of this world I imagine where I've given up using my car as the primary way to get around is that _almost everyone else has as well_.

In this world, people still use cars. Doctor appointments, moving unusually heavy loads, and mobility for those with movement disabilities are all good reasons to get in a car. But it's more annoying to drive than it is today. If you've ever driven down NW 21st in Portland, you know what this feels like; you have to be careful of pedestrians and bikers who use the road heavily. Cars are not the first concern of city planners and infrastructure anymore; instead, they are guests that have to mind their manners.

On the plus side, driving is a whole lot safer with so few commuters in cars. Most of the road traffic would be buses, delivery trucks, and other special purpose vehicles, along with lots of bikers. Cars currently kill over 35,000 people a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. According to the CDC in 2019, 608 children 12 and under died in car accidents, and caused over 91,000 injuries. Imagine how much fewer that would be if most people got around another way!

## A World with More Buses and Bikes

If we aren't taking cars everywhere, we need other ways of moving around, and luckily we don't need much innovation to get there: bikes and buses already exist! What we need is a lot more buses (electric, please!) and better bike infrastructure.

Buses and other public transit like light rail feel more fraught in a COVID world. My family has been extremely cautious and we haven't gotten on public transit since the pandemic started. However, with vaccines for kids on the horizon, we hope to be using public transit more again soon. A world with better public transit starts with frequency. If you are a little late to a bus (or if the bus driver is a little bit ahead of schedule), it shouldn't mean you have to wait 15, 30, or even 60 minutes for the next bus; ideally, we should be able to count on the next one coming in five to eight minutes.

In this world with fewer cars, getting on a bike is much less frightening than it is now. When my little kid rides his bike on the sidewalk, I feel a certain amount of stress; I have to be very vigilant at crosswalks, especially ones that are poorly designed for those of us who are rolling rather than walking. I haven't gotten a bike myself, because I worry I don't have the skills I need to be safe on the road. Even skilled bikers don't stand much of a chance against a careless car. A world where bikers dominate the roads mean far fewer fatal accidents. Electric bikes help even the ability playing field; biking isn't just for someone who is young and fit; more people can get on bikes without worrying about getting up a hill on their way or being exhausted at the end.

In this world, the air is cleaner and quieter, and walking becomes much more pleasant. In my neighborhood, there are areas I simply don't visit on foot because the traffic is unpleasant to deal with. If the busy, loud roads were mostly used by bikers and a few buses, I would feel much better about walking there, especially with little kids. We might notice the roar of a bus going by more, but we will notice it because it contrasts with the relatively quiet roadways that bikes and pedestrians use.

In this world, everyone is healthier. The air we breathe is cleaner. We are more likely to get exercise, whether it's getting to our bus stop or getting to our destination on our feet or our wheels. We are more connected to our communities by actually being in them rather than driving through them. All of these enhance our personal health and relieve pressure off our healthcare systems.

## A Verdant, Shady, Beautiful World

Imagine a world that isn't so beholden to paved places to put cars. How much greener and cooler would our world be? Think of how much land there would be available if every parking lot was cut in half or more, especially the big box store parking lots. We could use that space to create increased density with apartment buildings, green parks that cool our cities and give us mental and physical respite, and additional community and commercial space.

How much space could we reclaim on our roads, and what could we do with it? Possibilities include wider sidewalks, more space for street trees and plants that keep us cool, better bike infrastructure, and additional space for retail and restaurants outside their storefronts. On very wide roads (5 lanes or wider), I sometimes daydream of depaving the middle of it to create green lanes with native trees and plants that will interrupt the heat bubble being formed by the asphalt. I think of how beautiful it would be from above, seeing our cities with green lanes through what used to be choked, car-filled arteries.

## A Neighborly World

One of the things I love about my neighborhood is walking around and getting a sense of who lives here and running into friends. When I get into my car, I am cutting myself off from making those human connections. I often think about how much safer our neighborhoods would be if we all knew each other better. How much more connected would we feel? How much better would our mental health be if we got a little dose of social interaction, rather than boxing ourselves into a car and dealing with the stresses of driving?

This is the world I want for myself and for my family. Now, to find the ways to make it happen!
