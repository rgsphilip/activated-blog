I'm in a season where I don't have much time and need to prioritize self care and rest. For now, I'm going to do small, weekly updates of the small pieces of work I'm doing during this season.

- I walked around Evelyn Schiffler Park with another neighborhood organizer. In February, our [Neighborhood Association Committees](https://www.beavertonoregon.gov/487/Neighborhood-Association-Committees-NACs) and Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation District organized a volunteer powered tree planting, where we planted 14 trees near the playground. We walked around the park to discuss where the park could use more trees, when we should plant, and how best to get started with THPRD's partnership.

- I wrote a few [Vote Forward](https://votefwd.org/) letters; they have a ton of different campaigns you can write letters for! I wrote going to voters in Texas to encourage them to vote in November's midterms.

- I read some more of Building the Cycling City: The Dutch Blueprint for Urban Vitality.
